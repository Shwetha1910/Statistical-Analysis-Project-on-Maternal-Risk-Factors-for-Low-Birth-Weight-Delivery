# Statistical-Analysis-Project-on-Maternal-Risk-Factors-for-Low-Birth-Weight-Delivery
This project aimed to identify maternal risk factors for low birth weight (LBW) using machine learning techniques. We compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Bagged Trees, and Random Forest (RF) models to determine the best classifier for predicting LBW. The dataset included 180 cases with 10 predictors, and key variables such as maternal age, weight, smoking status, and hypertension history were analyzed. The data was cleaned and split into training and testing sets. Our findings revealed that maternal age and weight are significant predictors of LBW. Among the models, Random Forest proved to be the most accurate, with the lowest mean squared error and out-of-bag error. This study highlights the importance of addressing maternal health factors to prevent LBW.
